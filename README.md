# Nuxt3-tailwind-gsap-loco
This is a starter template for Nuxt 3 projects with Tailwind, Gsap scrollTrigger plugin and Locomotive scroll.
For now it's really simple and I might miss some functionalities.

# Getting started
clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/teo-goulois/Nuxt3-tailwind-gsap-loco.git
```

Make sure that you have Node.js installed on your project. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```
Run this command to compile and bundle the source code:

```
npm run dev
```
Run this command to build the project:
```
npm run build
```

# Typescript
I wanted to use Typescript for this so it's easy to start with. but there is some place where I had to use `// @ts-ignore`, i will try to erase them all, with the time.
